# Simple recreation of the dts bloat generation.

This is an example of how simple typescript usage can lead to a bloated dts file.

## Look at `dist/index.d.ts`

This is the `.d.ts` file that was generated by TypeScript compiler.
All the external type are imported with the dynamic import syntax, which is very wasteful.

### How run locally

```bash
npm i
npm run build
```

Then look at the `dist/index.d.ts` file.
